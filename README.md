Hello.  This is a website rebuild for a local escape room and axe throwing business.  It's built on Express and React.
It also uses Framer Motion for some basic animations and transitions.  It's integrated with a Resova, an external database
and bookkeeping service, as well as GoogleMaps.  It's deployed on AWS and uses Nginx as a load balancer and reserse proxy.

If you're in the area, feel free to visit and say Jason sent you.
